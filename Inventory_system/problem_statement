Problem Statement
Imagine you're managing the inventory for a warehouse that stores various items, each with a unique identifier (such as a product code or serial number). The inventory system is structured as a binary search tree, where each node represents an item in the inventory, and the values of the nodes correspond to the item quantities.
Let's say the warehouse supervisor needs to assess the inventory levels of certain products within a specified quantity range to determine restocking priorities.
For example:
● "low" could represent the minimum quantity threshold, indicating the minimum number of items required to maintain stock levels.
● "high" could represent the maximum quantity threshold, indicating the maximum number of items that can be stored before excess inventory is reached.

Your task is to develop a function within the inventory management system that takes the root node of the binary search tree representing the inventory, 
along with the minimum and maximum quantity thresholds (low and high), and returns the total quantity of items within this specified range.

Requirements:
Formulate an efficient algorithm using BST to perform the above task.
