Problem Statement
You have gone fishing in the river. The river is located to the right of the buildings. There are ‘n’ buildings in a line.
You are given an integer array of heights of size n that represents the heights of the buildings in the line.
A building has a river view if the building can see the river without obstructions. Formally, a building has a river view if all the buildings to its right have a smaller height.
Return a list of indices (0-indexed) of buildings that have a river view, sorted in increasing order.

We are implementing the above problem statement using STACKS.
